# Set-up for Students

### Step 1: Create Your GitHub Account

If you already have one under some other email account and want to use it for the code review, then please go to the next section. Otherwise:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" 
3. Choose a username (tip: use something professional as you might use this for job applications later!)
4. Use your UCL email address
5. Create a strong password
6. Verify your email when GitHub sends you a message

### Step 2: Upload Your Assignment to Moodle
- Submit your code assignment to Moodle as you normally would
- **Also include your GitHub username** in your submission or as requested by your teacher
